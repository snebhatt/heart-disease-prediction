# Heart Disease Prediction using SVM and SGD Classifiers

This project builds a machine learning pipeline to predict heart disease using Support Vector Machine(SVM) and Stochastic Gradient Descent(SGD) classifiers. My objective is to compare the performance of these two models in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

## Dataset

The dataset used in this project is the "Heart Disease Dataset". Download url: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/johnsmith88/heart-disease-dataset.

## Project Structure

The project consists of the following files:
- `train.py`: Script to train and evaluate the SVM model.
- `train_sgd.py`: Script to train and evaluate the SGD model.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Create a conda environment and then install the essential libraries such as Metaplotlib, Pandas, Seaborn and scikit-learn.
